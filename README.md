UpLearn Engagement vs Chemistry Attainment: Investigating a data driven approach to improving UpLearn engagement
Objectives: To find the best measure of engagement to improve UpLearn outcomes and find the correlation between UpLearn engagement and attainment in A-Level Chemistry.
Dataset: Sourced UpLearn engagement data for Year 12 and 13 Chemistry students & attainment scores for both groups of students in the Autumn (& Y13 Spring Term)
Methodology: 
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Removing missing values
- Filtering out students with EAL/SEN flags
- Merging datasets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Summary statistics
- Engagement distribution
- Correlation Analysis
- Heatmaps
- Scatter plots
- Regression Analysis: Simple OLS regression
- Model evaluation
- T-Test Analysis: Comparing performance of high vs low engagement students

Technologies:
- Python
- PowerBI
- Excel

Results & Findings:
- With Year 13s, the higher the UpLearn engagement, the lower their attainment was.
- With Year 12s, the higher the UpLearn engagement, the higher their attainment.
- The best measure of UpLearn was the average section score rather than the time spent on the website.

Future Work:
- Testing the relationship between attendance and student attainment
- Exploring the link between the Index of Deprivity and Student Attainment
